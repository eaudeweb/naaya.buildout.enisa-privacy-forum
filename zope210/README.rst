Privacy Forum Buildout
==================

This package is designed to help you install Naaya and its dependencies,
including Zope, with the magic of the Buildout_ utility.

The installation has been tested with Python 2.4.6 on Linux, Mac and Windows
(see `windows instructions`_).

.. _Buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
.. _`windows instructions`: http://naaya.eaudeweb.ro/docs/buildout_windows.html

Prerequisites
-------------

* a working compiler

  - For Debian install the build-essential package.
  - On the Mac install "developer tools".

* Python 2.4, compiled with zlib

  - For Debian, this means python2.4 and python2.4-dev (you may also need
    python-profile from non-free if you want to run unit tests).

* Glib

  - We need to compile itools which depends on glib (libglib2.0-dev in Debian)
  - On the Mac, the simplest way is to install `homebrew`_ and then run::

        brew install glib

.. _`homebrew`: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

Installation
------------

1. Download the buildout kit::

    svn co https://svn.eionet.europa.eu/repositories/Naaya/buildout/Naaya/trunk naaya
    cd naaya
    mv naaya.cfg buildout.cfg # so we don't have to specify its name all the time

2. Run bootstrap (replace python2.4 with your local python 2.4 binary)::

    python2.4 bootstrap.py -c enisa_privacy_forum.cfg --distribute

3. Run the buildout. This fetches dependencies and installs them::

    bin/buildout -c enisa_privacy_forum.cfg

You should end up with a Naaya/Zope distribution in the buildout folder. Zope
and some dependencies are placed in the "parts" folder, and the Naaya egg and
dependencies are placed in the "eggs" folder. bin/zope-instance is a script that
works like zopectl. To start your new Zope, run::

    bin/zope-instance start

A Manager account is created for you (user: admin, password: admin).


Installing PIL
--------------

Reference: http://wiki.python.org/moin/MacPython/UniversalLibrariesAndExtensions
In order to correctly compile and install PIL you have to install the following
libraries:

* ``libjpeg-dev`` for JPEG support
* ``libpng-dev`` for PNG support
* ``zlib1g-dev`` for ZIP compression (GIF/PNG), name may differ on other
  linux distros

Download and unpack PIL to a temporary dir::

    $ wget http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz
    $ cd Imaging-1.1.6

Try to build first, using the python you wish to install to::

        $ <your-python-path>/bin/python setup.py build_ext -i

If all goes well, you should have displayed something like this::

        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        PIL 1.1.6 BUILD SUMMARY
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        version       1.1.6
        platform      linux2 2.4.6 (#2, Mar 19 2009, 10:00:53)
                    [GCC 4.3.3]
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        *** TKINTER support not available
        --- JPEG support ok
        --- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support ok
        --- FREETYPE2 support ok
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        To add a missing option, make sure you have the required
        library, and set the corresponding ROOT variable in the
        setup.py script.

You can also run the tests that come with the library::

        $ <your-python-path>/bin/python selftest.py
        57 tests passed.

You may now proceed to installation::

        $ <your-python-path>/bin/python setup.py install
